## About us

**The Walk'In Fish is fresh**

The Walk'In Fish is for everyone who wants to eat delicious and relaxed in the center of Rotterdam with friends, family or for a night out with your partner.<br />
Restaurant The Walk'In Fish has the same owner as former Restaurant Savage.

Come and meet our new Chef Danny Mouthaan. Previously he worked at Zeezout, Oud Sluis, Juuls and Vineum.
Together with his Sous Chef Mike Winchester, amazing dishes are made.

We work in close collaboration with Schmidt Zeevis the best fish supplier of Holland
so that we get everything fresh every day.
Sustainable products are important for us but also beautiful bycatch which we combine with organic garnishes.
We serve various fish every day, but we also have dishes for the vegetarian and the real carnivore.
This way we work with honest products.<br />
We live on nature, but nature also has to live.

With kind regards,

Team The Walk'In Fish<br />
and<br />
Xander Rodrigues<br />
Owner The Walk'In Fish and Restaurant Savage
